# Data Structures and Algorithms
I wanted to learn more about data structures and algorithms, so I implemented my own spin on them in JS in this repo. Tests in Jest. Thanks to Brian Holt (@btholt) and Ale Miralles (@amiralles) for the materials they've made available on data structures and algorithms.
